# Dynamic Readme

This NestJs app allows you to create a fully interactive profile README, such as [mine](https://github.com/Charles-Chrismann), by displaying functional minigames on the page.

It is inspired by [some other dynamic profile READMEs](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme) (I remember [timburgan's one](https://github.com/timburgan/timburgan) as a motivation to start) that work with GitHub Actions on issues or by images, like the [profile views counter service](https://github.com/antonkomarev/github-profile-views-counter).

This project takes a different approach by creating a new commit on the repository for most of the provided features.

## üí≠ Philosophy

As you can see on many GitHub users' profiles, the profile is often divided into multiple sections such as "About Me", "My Projects", "My Tools", "Contact Me" etc.

This project follows the same philosophy by dividing the file into what are called **modules**, which handle the logic and rendering of each section of the final file.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The core files and folders of the app are as follows:

- **`src/modules`**: contains both static and dynamic modules. Each module encapsulates the logic for its section of the file and is also responsible for rendering that specific section.  
- **`src/State.js`**: the `State` class manages all modules and the final rendering of the file.  
- **`src/services/ConfigService.ts`**: a utility class used to access environment variables and the configuration object.  
- **`src/services/ReadmeService.ts`**: a utility class used to interact with GitHub. Most of the time, you‚Äôll want to call `ReadmeService.updateReadmeAndRedirect()`. (Use `ReadmeService.doNothingAndRedirect()` if there are no changes to apply.)  
- **`src/services/RequestService.ts`**: a utility class used to interact with the GitHub REST and GraphQL APIs.

A module can extend either the **AbstractStaticModule**, which means it is not likely to change ‚Äî for example, an ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù section.

A module can also extend the **AbstractDynamicModule**, which means it will change over time ‚Äî for example, a chess game or a ‚ÄúLatest Followers‚Äù section.

The workflow in all modules/games follows the same pattern:

1. The user clicks a link in the README and makes a GET request to the app.
2. The involved controller is called.
3. The associated service is called.
4. If a commit is needed, the app waits for the commit to be performed.
5. The app returns a redirection to the client for the profile README page that has been updated.

This results in a seemingly simple page refresh for the user.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Requirements:
  - Docker
  - Node & NPM

Steps:
1. git clone https://github.com/Charles-Chrismann/dynamic-readme
2. dupe .env.example and rename it .env, fill variables
3. dupe config.example.json and rename it config.json, fill variables

> [!NOTE]
> Some modules like the Gba module might required additional setup

<details>
  <summary>üë®‚Äçüíª Developpement</summary>

```sh
npm run dev
```

equivalent to: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --watch`

> you might need to trigger the hot reload to get the latest version of the app.

<details>
  <summary>üöÄ Production</summary>

```sh
npm run prod
```

equivalent to: `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d`

</details>

<details>
  <summary>üìÇ Utility commands</summary>

delet all volumes

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --env-file .env.dev down -v
```

docker system df
docker builder prune

redis cli

```
redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379
KEYS *
```

Backup

```sh
docker exec dr-prod-redis redis-cli save
docker cp dr-prod-redis:/data/dump.rdb ./dump.rdb
```

Restore

```sh
docker cp ./dump.rdb dr-prod-redis:/data/dump.rdb
docker restart dr-prod-redis
```

If docker seems to use an old versin of the code

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --env-file .env.dev down --volumes --remove-orphans
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --env-file .env.dev build --no-cache
```
